An Enjoyable and Insightful Exchange!

During the FISITA Intelligent Safety Conference China (ISCC 2024), it was an honor to invite three experts (Prof. Abbas Jamalipour, EIC IEEE TVT, Dr. Jost Bernasch,  CEO of Virtual Vehicle Research GmbH, and Dr. Michael Paulweber, Dir. Research & Technology ITS, AVL List GesmbH) to visit the School of Automotive Studies, Tongji University and our TJIIV Lab.

I shared my recent research, the achievements of our lab, and highlights of our school's intelligent connected vehicle testing and evaluation base, wind tunnel, and formula racing car. We exchanged fascinating perspectives and I learned a lot from them. 

Looking forward to meeting again in the future!
